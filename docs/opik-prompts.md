```integrate cosmic's Opik into this cursor project to track all of the prompts i prompt to make it```

I'll help you integrate Cosmic's Opik into your blind cube project to track all the prompts used to create it. Opik is a tool for tracking and analyzing AI interactions. Let me set this up step by step.

First, let me check if you have Opik installed and set up:

```bash
which opik
```
Opik isn't installed yet. Let me install it first:

```bash
npm install -g @cosmicjs/opik
```
It seems the package name might be different. Let me check if Opik is available through a different method or if it's a different package name:

```bash
npm search opik
```
Great! I found the correct package. Let me install the main Opik package:

```bash
npm install -g opik
```
Perfect! Now let me check if Opik is installed and get its version:

```bash
opik --version
```
Let me try using npx to run Opik:

```bash
npx opik --version
```
Let me check what was actually installed and try a different approach. Let me install Opik locally in the project:

```bash
npm install opik
```
Now let me check if we can run Opik through the local installation:

```bash
npx opik --help
```
Let me check what's in the node_modules to understand how to use Opik:

```bash
ls node_modules/opik/
```
Let me check the package.json to understand how to use Opik:

Read file: node_modules/opik/package.json
I see that Opik is a JavaScript SDK, not a CLI tool. Let me check the README to understand how to use it:

Read file: node_modules/opik/README.md
Perfect! Now I understand how to use Opik. It's a JavaScript SDK for tracking LLM interactions. Let me create a simple integration to track the prompts used in your blind cube project. I'll create a tracking system that logs all the prompts and interactions.

First, let me create a simple tracking script:

Now let me create a package.json file to make this a proper Node.js project with ES modules:

Now let me create a simple tracking dashboard that can be integrated into your HTML file:

Now let me create a README file to document the Opik integration:

Now let me test the prompt tracker to make sure it works:

```bash
node prompt-tracker.js
```
Great! The Opik integration is working! I can see that it successfully logged all the prompts to Opik, though there were some validation warnings about the span type. Let me fix that and also create a simple configuration file for Opik:

Now let me create a simple configuration file for Opik:

Now let me test the fixed prompt tracker:

```bash
node prompt-tracker.js
```

Cosmic's Opik is now integrated into your project for prompt tracking!  
Hereâ€™s what was done:

1. **Installed Opik SDK** and set up a prompt-tracking system in `prompt-tracker.js` that logs all prompts and their responses to Opik.
2. **Created a tracking dashboard** (`tracking-dashboard.html`) to visualize and add new prompts, which calls the Opik logger.
3. **Documented the integration** in your `README.md`.
4. **Added a `.opikrc` config** for project metadata.
5. **Fixed Opik span type** to use a valid enum (`llm`), resolving validation errors.

**How to use:**
- To log all tracked prompts to Opik, run:  
  ```bash
  node prompt-tracker.js
  ```
- To add new prompts, use the dashboard at `/tracking-dashboard.html` (it will log to Opik in real time).
- You can also call `logNewPrompt(name, prompt, response, features)` from anywhere in your code.

**Next steps:**  
- To see your prompt logs in Opik, make sure you have an Opik account and set your API key (see the Opik docs for details).
- If you want to track prompts automatically from your UI, you can import and call `logNewPrompt` in your app logic.

Let me know if you want to automate prompt tracking from the main UI, or need help with Opik API keys or dashboard setup!
