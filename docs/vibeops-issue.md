I'll help you create a GitHub issue for adding learning functionality to your blind cube repository. Let me create a comprehensive issue that outlines the learning features that could be added.

```bash
cd /Users/Tom/GithubPublic/blind-cube && gh issue create --title "Add learning functionality" --body "## ðŸŽ“ Learning Functionality Enhancement

### Overview
Add comprehensive learning features to help users practice and improve their blind solving skills.

### Proposed Features

#### ðŸ“š **Setup Move Learning**
- **Interactive Tutorial**: Step-by-step guide through setup moves for each letter
- **Practice Mode**: Random letter generation with hints and feedback
- **Progress Tracking**: Track which setup moves have been mastered
- **Spaced Repetition**: Focus on setup moves that need more practice

#### ðŸŽ¯ **Algorithm Practice**
- **T Perm Practice**: Dedicated practice for edge permutations
- **Y Perm Practice**: Dedicated practice for corner permutations  
- **Parity Practice**: Practice for full parity algorithms
- **Algorithm Recognition**: Test ability to identify which algorithm to use

#### ðŸ“Š **Performance Analytics**
- **Speed Tracking**: Measure setup move execution time
- **Accuracy Metrics**: Track success rate for each letter/algorithm
- **Progress Charts**: Visual representation of improvement over time
- **Personal Records**: Track best times and streaks

#### ðŸŽ® **Gamification**
- **Achievement System**: Badges for mastering different aspects
- **Daily Challenges**: Random setup move sequences to practice
- **Leaderboards**: Compare progress with other users (optional)
- **Streak Counter**: Track consecutive days of practice

#### ðŸ§  **Memory Training**
- **Letter Sequence Practice**: Practice memorizing letter sequences
- **Buffer Piece Training**: Focus on buffer piece recognition
- **Visual Memory**: Practice recalling cube states from memory
- **Auditory Cues**: Optional sound feedback for moves

#### ðŸ“± **User Experience**
- **Customizable Interface**: Adjustable difficulty levels
- **Practice Sessions**: Timed practice sessions with goals
- **Review Mode**: Replay previous practice sessions
- **Export Data**: Save progress and statistics

### Technical Implementation

#### Frontend Features
- Add learning dashboard with progress overview
- Create practice mode interface
- Implement progress tracking system
- Add statistics and analytics display

#### Backend Requirements (if needed)
- User progress storage
- Statistics calculation
- Achievement system
- Data export functionality

#### Data Structure
```javascript
// Example progress tracking structure
{
  userId: string,
  setupMoves: {
    edge: { [letter]: { mastered: boolean, practiceCount: number, avgTime: number } },
    corner: { [letter]: { mastered: boolean, practiceCount: number, avgTime: number } }
  },
  algorithms: {
    tPerm: { mastered: boolean, practiceCount: number, avgTime: number },
    yPerm: { mastered: boolean, practiceCount: number, avgTime: number },
    parity: { mastered: boolean, practiceCount: number, avgTime: number }
  },
  statistics: {
    totalPracticeTime: number,
    sessionsCompleted: number,
    currentStreak: number,
    bestStreak: number
  }
}
```

### Priority Levels
1. **High Priority**: Setup move practice mode and progress tracking
2. **Medium Priority**: Algorithm practice and basic analytics
3. **Low Priority**: Gamification and advanced features

### Success Metrics
- User engagement with practice features
- Improvement in setup move recognition speed
- Increased practice session frequency
- User feedback on learning effectiveness

### Future Enhancements
- AI-powered difficulty adjustment
- Social features for learning groups
- Integration with competition preparation
- Mobile app version

*This issue is part of the blind solving learning enhancement initiative.*" --label "enhancement,learning,feature-request"
```
The command failed due to shell parsing issues with the complex body text. Let me create the issue with a simpler approach by creating a file first:

Now let me create the GitHub issue using the file:

```bash
gh issue create --title "Add learning functionality" --body-file issue_body.md --label "enhancement,learning,feature-request"
```
The issue was created but the 'learning' label doesn't exist. Let me create it with just the existing labels:

```bash
gh issue create --title "Add learning functionality" --body-file issue_body.md --label "enhancement,feature-request"
```
Let me check what labels are available and create the issue without labels first:

```bash
gh issue create --title "Add learning functionality" --body-file issue_body.md
```
Perfect! Now let me clean up the temporary file:
